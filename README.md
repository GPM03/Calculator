This is a simple calculator built with HTML, CSS an JS. This is the last project of The Odin Project foundations course.

Most of my effort went into the styling rather than the JS, because i wanted some fancy effects, with round buttons while still making it responsive in all screen sizes.

Functionalities
- ability to add, subtract, multiply and divide
- each operation consists of one number, an operator and another number
- clear button
- decimal separator button
- backspace button
- percent button
- switch sign button
- keyboard support
